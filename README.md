## A small nextjs tool for a friend

This is a tool for a friend to modify his overly complicated wordpress site.
His site, loads data from csv files.
Microsoft excel, the most common spreadsheet editor is known for altering csv files. 
Therefore my friend who uses excel is likely to mess up his site.

So instead of fixing the complicated wordpress done by other people, I used my knowledge on React, Node and Wordpress to tap into his wordpress API, and generate this tool which 
reads his current csv files, displays them on a page and allows him to edit those files, without the ability of adding new rows.
And after he is done he can save the file and upload it directly to wordrpess.
